### Coupled Oscillators

Consider $n$ masses on a wire connected by springs that obey Hooke's law with no forcing or damping.
`ch03/oscillation/oscillation.cpp` computes displacement from equilibrium over time.
Sample input `/test/input.txt` from Exercise 3.13.
Animation `test/animate.gp` using `gnuplot` and `ffmpeg`.

### Scattering from finite barriers

To be continued.
